Message Filters --- chained message processing
==============================================

:mod:`message_filters` is a collection of message "filters" which take messages in,
either from a ROS subscription or another filter,
and may or may not output the message
at some time in the future, depending on a policy defined for that filter.

message_filters also defines a common interface for these filters, allowing you to chain them together.

The filters currently implemented in this package are:

 * :class:`message_filters.Subscriber` - A source filter, which wraps a ROS subscription.  Most filter chains will begin with a Subscriber.
 * :class:`message_filters.Cache` - Caches messages which pass through it, allowing later lookup by time stamp.
 * :class:`message_filters.TimeSynchronizer` - Synchronizes multiple messages by their timestamps, only passing them through when all have arrived.
 * :class:`message_filters.TimeSequencer` - Tries to pass messages through ordered by their timestamps, even if some arrive out of order.

Here's a simple example of using a Subscriber with a Cache::

    def myCallback(posemsg):
       print posemsg

    sub = message_filters.Subscriber(node_object, "pose_topic", robot_msgs.msg.Pose)
    cache = message_filters.Cache(sub, 10)
    cache.registerCallback(myCallback)

The Subscriber here acts as the source of messages.  Each message is passed to the cache, which then passes it through to the
user's callback ``myCallback``.


Using the time synchronizer::

    from message_filters import TimeSynchronizer, Subscriber

    def gotimage(image, camerainfo):
        assert image.header.stamp == camerainfo.header.stamp
        print "got an Image and CameraInfo"

    tss = TimeSynchronizer(Subscriber(node_object, "/wide_stereo/left/image_rect_color", sensor_msgs.msg.Image),
                           Subscriber(node_object, "/wide_stereo/left/camera_info", sensor_msgs.msg.CameraInfo))
    tss.registerCallback(gotimage)

Another example for syncronizing one image topic and one pointcloud2 topic using approximate synchronizer::


    from rclpy.node import Node
    from rclpy.qos import qos_profile_sensor_data
    from message_filters import ApproximateTimeSynchronizer, Subscriber
    from sensor_msgs.msg import Image, PointCloud2

    class ExampleNode(Node):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__("ExampleNode")

            self.image_sub = Subscriber(self, Image, "/image_topic")
            self.plc_sub = Subscriber(
                self, PointCloud2, "/point_cloud_topic", qos_profile=qos_profile_sensor_data
            )
            queue_size = 30
            # you can use ApproximateTimeSynchronizer if msgs dont have exactly the same timestamp
            self.ts = ApproximateTimeSynchronizer(
                [self.image_sub, self.plc_sub],
                queue_size,
                0.01,  # defines the delay (in seconds) with which messages can be synchronized
            )

        def callback(self, image_msg, pcl_msg):
            # do your stuff here
            pass

**Note**: It is **VERY IMPORTANT** that each subscriber has the same ``qos_profile`` as the one specified in the corresponding publisher code for each topic you want to subscribe to.
If they don't match, the callback won't be executed (without any warning) and you will be very frustrated.


The message filter interface
----------------------------

For an object to be usable as a message filter, it needs to have one method,
``registerCallback``.  To collect messages from a message filter, register a callback with::

    anyfilter.registerCallback(my_callback)

The signature of ``my_callback`` varies according to the message filter.  For many filters it is simply::
  
    def my_callback(msg):

where ``msg`` is the message.

Message filters that accept input from an upstream
message filter (e.g. :class:`message_filters.Cache`) register their own
message handler as a callback.

Output connections are registered through the ``registerCallback()`` function.
